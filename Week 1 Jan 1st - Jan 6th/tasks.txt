1. Programmed and ran collab notebooks to make a basic goal of the problem I'm solving
2. Made a GitHub repo for all my work like Dr. Aditya asked
3. Started a PyTorch series on Youtube so that I can brushen up on some things I'm not sure about. Taking notes too: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n-iq4bbdU1uCsw01ICYIQ0CqVQtF36pYVvax459tR3U/edit?usp=sharing
